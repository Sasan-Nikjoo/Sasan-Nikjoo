## 🧠 About Me

I'm **Sasan Nikjoo**, a front-end developer with hands-on experience in designing and implementing intuitive user interfaces. I'm currently pursuing my **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering** at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. I love working with modern frameworks like **React**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**, and I'm always exploring new technologies to improve user experience and code quality.

I’ve contributed to both small and large-scale projects—from UI components to full application features—and enjoy working in collaborative teams that value continuous learning and clean architecture.
